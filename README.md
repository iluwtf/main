# Vision

We see a world where single use plastic is no more.

# Mision

The idea is to create change by showing the brands that we like that are still using plastic, that we are angry! But, that we want them to change, that we believe they can change. If we all do that, maybe we can make a difference.

# Tactics

A simple place for people to tag photos of the products they like with a ILU.WTF icon, and make it easy for people to share those photos in social media.


*For example*: Some people love gatorade, but it comes on that thick plastic bottles, perhaps if millions of people share that they like them, but they would like to replace the plastic bottle for something friendlier to the environment.
