# A movement to terminate single-use plastics!


We've all been there, you order from your favourite place, and, it all comes with a bunch of plastic stuff, deep inside you know that straw, the cup, etc, it will all end up in the Ocean... Yet there we are buying it again and again. **But, we can change this!!**, next time we buy and see plastic, we can use social media to tell those brands: **Hey! I love you but WTF? this needs to change!**

### #iluWTF in two steps:.

1. **See plastic on the brand you like?** Press the button  <a href="https://ilu.wtf/camera/index.html?v=1"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/ILU.WTF%20Camera-00B388?logo=DoIt&logoColor=fff&style=for-the-badge" alt="Launch in ILU.WTF Camera"></a> And take a photo.

2. **Share in your social media:** Tag the brand, plus your friends that also love that brand and add the #iluWTF @iluWTF tags.
