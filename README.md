## Why?

We've all been there, you order from your favourite place, and, it all comes with a bunch of plastic stuff, deep inside you know that straw, the cup, etc, it will all end up in the Ocean... Yet there we are buying it again and again. **But, we can change this!!**, next time we buy and see plastic, we can use social media to tell those brands: **Hey! I love you but WTF? this needs to change!**
